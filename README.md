# ukulele

 Dear user!

We are second year students of International Alatoo University
and here we present a 3D printable ukulele-toy model
(music instrument , like a small guitar).
Parts of instrument were created in Blender application ,
than exported as .stl files and by importing presented in OpenScad.
So you can find different types of files - .blender , .stl and .scad.
Stl files present different parts of ukulele , that were assembled
together in OpenScad. The main result can viewed in
ukuNeck.scad file - the neck of instrument and
ukuHead.scad file - the head of instrument,
these parts can be assembled as a constructor after ukulele has been printed.
